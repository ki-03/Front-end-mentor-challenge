Project's Title : Desktop First solution using HMTL and CSS

Project Description:
This a simple front-end mentor challenge to build a recipie page using HTML and CSS. 
As the project was fairly simple to build there were some challenges,I faced like while 
putting up the margins and paddings I realized that it will be better if we use % rather 
than px cause px will be fixed and later on while desiginig your page using CSS it creates a problem.

I used front-end mentor's challenges and wish to continue using their challenges as I get into more 
complex ones. During the projects I also took help form the internet and down below are the links for
all the resources that I used during my time building the projet.
